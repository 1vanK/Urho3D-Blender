io_mesh_urho v0.4

This is a Blender addon that helps you exporting your meshes, armatures, animations and materials to Urho3D.
It is an amateur work, done with little knowledge of Urho3D and Blender, but I hope it helps.

 Installation
--------------
- download the zip file from GitHub and unzip it;
- select the folder 'io_mesh_urho' and re-create a zip file (you need the folder 'io_mesh_urho' in the zip file);
- open Blender;
- open 'user preferences' (Ctrl+Alt+U);
- click 'Addons' on the top bar;
- click 'Install from file...' on the bottom bar;
- select your created zip file;
- now search in the list, you should see a greyed line named 'Import-Export: Urho3D export';
- click on the checkbox on the right to enable the addon (see below if you can't set the check);
- optional: click 'Save User Settings' to remember this addon as enabled.

 Uncheckable box
----------------
If you can't check the checkbox, there is an error in the exporter and I'll try to fix it. In the 'Window' menu
of Blender, select 'Toggle System Console' to see the error, copy and email it to me, thank you.

 Exporter location in Blender
------------------------------
The exporter is located in:
- Properties panel, by default it is the panel in the right bottom corner, its icon is an horizontal scrollbar
- Render page (camera icon, it is the forst icon in the panel)
- towards the bottom of the panel (near Output and Bake sections), it is called 'Urho export'

================
 Exporter panel
================

- Button 'Export'
This button starts the export process using the current options.
- Page icon on the right
This button shows you the log of the last export process.

- 'Output folder'
This is where the exported files will be created. Click the folder icon on the right to browse and choose 
the folder.
- 'Use Urho standard folders'
Instead of using the folder above, it creates the sub-folder 'Models' to store meshes and animations, the 
sub-folder 'Textures' to store texture and the sub-folder 'Materials' to store materials.
- 'Files overwrite'
By default existing files are not overwritten by the exporter, this option enables overwriting files.

- Blank page icon on the right
Restore the default options.
- Objects
Select what objects you want to export:
  'All' export all the objects in the scene (hidden and moved included).
  'Only selected' export only the selected objects.
- Origin
Set the meshes origin:
  'Global' the origin of all the meshes will be the Blender global origin (the center of the grid).
  'Local' for each mesh the origin will be the object center (little orange dot).
- Scale
Apply a scale transformation on the object exported.
- Apply Modifier
If an object has some modifiers stacked, apply them to the mesh before exporting (with Preview or Render settings).
- Select vertices with errors
If a vertex has an error (missing element, invalid UV...), when the exporting is done go to Edit mode and select it.
- Force missing elements
Vertices can have different elements (position, normal, UV, bone weight), when you export a mesh you can choose 
which elements you want to export (see Geometries below). If a vertex in the mesh does not have an element selected
to be exported, an error is generated. This option prevents these errors forcing the missing elements to a default
value. (You should not use this option but instead try to correct the errors).
- Merge objects
Merge all the objects exported in one Urho model (with different geometries).
- One vertex buffer per object
Split each object into its own vertex buffer. If we can use a 16 bits index (instead of 32) when we use a buffer per
object, then this option is automatically selected.
- Use LODs
Export each 'Level Of Details' (LOD) present for each object (see LOD below).
  - Strict LODs
  If ON, the LOD will probably have new vertices and your LOD will be accurate as you see it in Blender. 
  If OFF, the LOD will try to use vertices of the first LOD and you could see some acceptable distorsions caused by 
  slightly off normals.
- Optimize indices
Try to sort triangles in the index buffer to gain an optimal use of the hardware vertices cache. In other words, this
option can speed up the rendering of the mesh. It can be very slow (5 minutes for 30K smooth vertices on an average pc).

- Skeletons
Export the object armature (skeleton).
  - Derigify
  Try to remove the control bones (.ORG) from the Rigify armature and keeps only the deform bones. (Not fully tested)
- Animations
Export the armature animations. It requires skeleton.
  'Timeline'
  'All tracks (not muted)'
  'All Strips'
  'Selected Tracks'
  'Selected Strips'
  'Actions used in tracks'
  'All Actions'
  - Only keyed bones: export only animation of bones with an animation key.
  - Position, Rotation, Scale: select what animation data to export.
- Geometries
Here you can select what vertex data to export:
  - Position: export vertices positions
  - Normal: export vertices normals
  - UV, UV2: export vertices UV coordinates (see UV below)
  - Tangent: export vertices tangents
  - Weights: export vertices bones weights
  - Color, Alpha: export vertices colors (see Colors below)
- Morphs
Export not muted shape keys (Morphs):
  - Normal: export morphed vertices normals
  - Tangent: export morphed vertices tangents
- Export materials
Export the object materials (see Materials below).
  - Materials text list: in the models folder create a text file with the same name of the model, inside there is
    the list of the material files exported that are used by the model.
- Copy textures  
Copy the textures used by the objects materials to the output folder. Sometimes this does not work, especially when
the images are embedded in the blend file are no format was specified for them.

=====
 LOD
=====
To create a LOD: append to the object name "_LOD00.0" (for example "house_LOD00.0"), duplicate the object, rename it
changing the number after '_LOD' with the distance up to this LOD is visible (for example "house_LOD00.0"), reduce its
vertices (you can use the decimator modifier), repeat these two steps until you have the desired number of LODs.
You can use float or integer numbers, it is important that the numbers are right aligned in the object names.
For example: house_LOD005, house_LOD010, house_LOD100... but not: house_LOD5, house_LOD10, house_LOD100...

=====
 UV
=====
To export UV you need an UV map, you can see the list in the Data page of the current selected object.
The Urho MDL format supports two sets of UV coordinates. You can specify what maps to use by appending "_UV1" or
"_UV2" to the layer name. These suffixes can be used together but also alone, if they are missing the first used
layer will be choosen.
If the exporter reports some "Invalid UV" this means that some triangles of the mesh are mapped in the UV map to
triangles with an area null or too small. You need to increase the area in the UV map, you can set the option
'Select vertices with errors' to find these triangles.

========
 Colors
========
To export vertex colors you need an Color map, you can see the list in the Data page of the current selected object.
Blender colors do not support have alpha, so if you need alpha you need two Color maps, one for the color and one for
the alpha. You need to specify these maps by appending "_RGB" and "_ALPHA" respectively to the layer name. These
suffixes can be used together but also alone, if they are missing the first layer will be choosen for RGB only.
For the alpha color layer use a scale of grey (black=transparent, white=opaque), starting from black or white you can
use the Value slider (V in HSV) to easy change a greyscale color.

===========
 Materials
===========
The exporter will try to generate Urho3D materials that are similar to what you see in Blender, they will not be the
exact same but at least you have a starting point.
This feature works only with the 'Blender Render' engine not Cycles. It will probably need some corrections.

This is how a Blender material option (on the left) is converted to a Urho3D material option (on the right):

--- Blender Material ---
Diffuse.Color * Diffuse.Intesity       = MatDiffColor rgb
Transparency.Alpha [value if enabled]  = MatDiffColor alpha
Specular.Color * Specular.Intesity     = MatSpecColor rgb
Specular.Hardness                      = MatSpecColor power

--- Blender Object Data ---
Normals.DoubleSided [if true]          = set material 'cull' and 'shadowcull' to 'none' (=double sided material)

Note: the double sided option is true by default in Blender and so will be the materials exported. To manually remove
double side from a XML material you can simply delete the 'cull' and 'shadowcull' lines.

--- Blender Textures ---
Influence.Diffuse.Color [if enabled]   = diffuse  texture and add 'Diff'     to technique
Influence.Geometry.Normal [if enabled] = normal   texture and add 'Normal'   to technique
Influence.Specular.Color [if enabled]  = specular texture and add 'Specular' to technique
Influence.Shading.Emit [if enabled]    = emissive texture and add 'Emissive' to technique
Influence.Shading.Emit [value]         = MatEmissiveColor rgb
[if texture slot name contains '_AMBIENTLIGHT'] = emissive texture and add 'AO'       to technique
[if texture slot name contains '_LIGHTMAP']     = emissive texture and add 'LightMap' to technique

Note: Textures must have Type='Image or Movie' and Mapping.Coordinates='UV'.
Note: The emissive color exported is a shade of grey, you can manually change it to any color.
Note: Emissive, AO, LightMap are exclusive.
Note: AO and LightMap use the coordinates UV2, so the texture slot name will be something like: 'name_LIGHTMAP_UV2'.

============
 Light maps
============
To define a texture to be exported as a light map you can insert '_AMBIENTLIGHT' or '_LIGHTMAP' in the texture slot 
name. You need to use a different set of UV coordinates and add '_UV2' at the end of the texture slot name or the
UV Map name.
It is simpler to use '_AMBIENTLIGHT' because many techniques are already present in Urho3D, you only need to add 
a Zone in your scene, its Ambient Color will modulate the light map.
